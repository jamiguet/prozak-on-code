Code examples from http://prozakcode.blogspot.ch/ 


Here you will find diverse code examples for the parts of my work which could be handy to use.
At the moment I am working on hadoop so most of the early parts will be based tools that fit into that
eco-system. 

So Far:
- Writeables: 
  A quick tour of how the pattern works with a sinple parcel example
- Coalescing: 
  Merging the fields of your objects on to disk, with the posibility of reading them back in compressed format
  not to blow up your memory. Then consumtion of the fields can be done via streams to keep your memory footprint 
  low and still have your data.
  
  
Enjoy.
